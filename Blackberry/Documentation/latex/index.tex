Me and Myself Here you should tell us about how your project works. How to run, any special things you have, etc. Also, explain any non-\/trivial design decisions you make. If you are working with a partner, clearly State what is each personâ€™s contribution. You should also comment on the stability of your code. Any big bugs should be listed here. Basically, anything that you think we need to know in general about your project should go here. Any additional comments you want to make can go here. Did you like the project? Was it too hard, too easy? My T\-A smells bad. Well, you get the idea. This initial documentation here should be removed. Or else you loose points.
